## Description
MarbleCrypt is a <i> fun, fun </i> game where you can collect your very own <i> Super Crypto Aesthetic Marble </i> NFTs!

You can obtain Marbles either by buying them with <b>$MTK</b> or by fusing two other basic marbles into a brand new one!

And these marbles aren't just for looks - they generate $MTK based on a daily yield, so in time, they become more valuable and you can even turn a profit by collecting as many marbles as you can!

Are you getting too many duplicates? No problem! At any time, you may choose to burn one of your marbles, to instantly get back some tokens for buying another one.

However, be careful of demand! The price for new marbles increases exponentialy with demand, so the more you buy, the more expensive they get!

Try to collect all the 16 base marbles, along with every combination of two of those!

### Disclaimer
This project is a reference to Logan Paul's *Cryptozoo*, a similar game [that was proved to be a cryptoscam](https://youtu.be/386p68_lDHA).
The use of the "Crypto coins" is purely fictional and just pokes fun at the idea of spending money on some PNG's of balls.
I do not endorse investing into cryptocoins or NFTs of any kind in real life.

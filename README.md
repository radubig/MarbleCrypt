## Description
MarbleCrypt is a <i> fun, fun </i> game where you can collect your very own <i> Super Crypto Aesthetic Marbles </i> NFTs (commonly reffered as <i>Marbles</i>) that yield
Marble Tokens <b>$MTK</b> on a daily basis!

You can obtain Marbles either by buying generators with <b>$MTK</b> or by fusioning two other Marbles into one!
